Overview
This repository contains the code for a prototype of a web application that showcases NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). The prototype utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the NASA API, to dynamically fetch and display the APOD image, title, explanation, and the date it was published.

Development Process
Step 1: Project Initialization

Set up the foundational project structure, including the following key files:
- index.html: The main HTML file for the web page.
- style.css: The CSS file for styling the page.
- script.js: The JavaScript file responsible for fetching and rendering APOD data.
- README.md: This documentation file.

Step 2: HTML Skeleton
Constructed the HTML structure for the web page, incorporating the following main components:
- A header section to display the project title.
- The main content area to present APOD content, enclosed within a visually appealing container.

Step 3: CSS Styling
- Applied CSS rules to style the HTML structure.
- Used Bootstrap to establish a responsive layout and provide basic styling elements.
- Customized the design to achieve a polished and centered presentation.

Step 4: JavaScript Functionality
- Implemented JavaScript code to interact with the NASA API.
- Utilized the provided API key to request APOD data from the API endpoint.
- Dynamically updated the web page with the APOD title, image, explanation, and the current date of publication.
- Implemented error handling to manage issues related to API requests and responses.

Step 5: Optimization
- Ensured that the APOD image displays responsively by setting a maximum width.
- Centered the current date element for enhanced visual appeal.

Resources Utilized
API
NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod): The primary source for obtaining APOD data.

Styling
Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/): Applied Bootstrap for foundational styling, layout, and responsiveness.

Challenges Encountered

- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the APOD image and content adapt well to different screen sizes.
- API Integration: Fetching APOD data from the NASA API, handling API response data, and managing errors.
- One notable challenge was the inability to attribute the owner of the picture
- Unable to add the next day's title
